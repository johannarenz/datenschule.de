    line1: "The nonprofit organization <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mediamonitoringafrica.org/\">Media Monitoring Africa</a> (MMA) is committed to a more responsible media coverage in Africa. MMA acts as a watchdog for ethical and fair journalism that supports human rights."
    line2: "During the elections in 2014, a small team of MMA manually evaluated several stories and articles published by newspapers, television and radio stations. The biggest challenge was to keep track of the contributions: they needed to be sorted, annotated, analyzed and compared to each other. A developer team from the CodeforAfrica program offered technical support with this task."
    line3: "During this cooperation a digital tool was developed, tailored specifically to the needs of all MMA employees working on the elections campaign. Within this tool data could be entered by all employees and processed automatically. Not only did this save much time, it also led to better <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://elections2014.mediamonitoringafrica.org/\">results</a>."
